# Codename: Senpai

Codename: Senpai is a unity remake of an old Javascript game created for a school project. This project exists as a warmup with the Unity engine and 2D game development. The name Codename: Senpai was derived from a joke by one of the original testers at the expense of the, shall we say "low-budget", art design.

## Plot
Montreal has declared war on Toronto, and missiles are inbound! With only an antiquated anti-air emplacement at your disposal, it is up to you to protect the city from the onslaught. Stay alive as long as you can, and enlist the help of other Torontonians to upgrade your defenses.

## Gameplay in a Nutshell
Randomly placed missiles fall from the sky, and a fixed-placement rotation cannon controlled by the player fires projectiles to destroy them.

## Stretch goals
- A day/night cycle: Gameplay during the day, a shop screen with upgrades at night.
- Powerups randomly dropped from missiles that, if shot, give either bonus cash or temporary buffs.
- Different, cyclable gun types. Single shot cannon, magazine-fed reloading gun, charge lightning, grapeshot. Individual ammo counts for each gun type.
- Extra missile types, possibly with different flight patterns, health, or powerup drop chances.
